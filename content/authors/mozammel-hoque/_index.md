I am a bioscience researcher interested in mirobiological research as it addresses the underlying mechanism of infectious diseases and leads to their cure. My research focuses on finding molecular mechanisms of adaptation and resistance in pathogenic bacteria against their predators like protozoa and bacteriophages. I use a range of wet and dry lab techniques to uncover the ever illusive microbial world.
