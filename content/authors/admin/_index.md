<!--StartFragment-->

I am a bioscience researcher focusing on finding molecular mechanisms of adaptation and resistance in pathogenic bacteria against their predators like protozoa and bacteriophages. I use a range of wet and dry lab techniques to uncover the ever-illusive microbial world.

I am passionate about data analysis, experienced in analysing biological data set using command-line interface, R programming and, a range of other visualisation tools.
